# Ludus Vitae
This is a simple Java application for [Conway's Game of Life](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for experimenting with the game.

## Features
This application focuses on simplicity over complicated features, but it still includes many features for easier use.

- **Wrapping**: Automatically wraps sides or disable
- **Cell Resizing**: Choose between large, normal, and tiny sizes
- **Board Resizing**: Resize board by dragging the boundary and using the keyboard shortcut
- **Speed**: Several speed levels to hurry evolution or let it slowly develop
- **Editing**: Toggle any cell and pause to do more
- **Save/Load**: Find a cool design? Save it with a memory efficient file
- **Themes**: Tired of black and white? Switch the colors yourself to find something fun

### Keyboard shortcuts
While most functionality is available in the menu bar, there are a few keyboard shortcuts to know.
- **P**: Pause the game, allowing you to edit some more cells
- **R**: Trigger a board resize after dragging the application boundary
- **C**: Clear the board 

## What's with the name? 
The name comes from Latin, literally meaning the "Game of Life". I previously made a Java application with the same name for Conway's Game of Life after completing the AP Computer Science A and being inspired by what programming could do, but it has unfortunately been lost to the dusty archives of time, which is why I am making sure to use version control this time!

## Roadmap
While this project is released, it has some areas for improvement. Here is the current roadmap, but I am not actively developing this project.

- [ ] Improve print version (originally just used for testing, what about a TUI?)
- [ ] File I/O
  - [ ] Use [RLE](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded#cite_note-niemiec-1) encryption
  - [ ] Connect with LifeWiki for searching
- [ ] Styling
  - [ ] Color based on # neigbors
  - [ ] Color based on time
- [ ] Marketing
  - [ ] Wireframe sketches
  - [ ] UML Diagrams
  - [ ] Document code
  - [ ] Icon
  - [ ] Demo video
  - [ ] GitHub Pages website
- [ ] Research
  - [ ] Optimizing memory
  - [ ] Optimising runtime (concurrency?)
